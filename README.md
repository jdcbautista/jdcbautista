### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Julius and I've been making art for almost a decade now.  Over the last year, I've been working hard on taking my art to the next level, studying programming while quietly producing a new body of work and fulfilling client commissions.

You're very likely here as a recruiter, since I have not yet shared this link with the public.  Yes, I am actively looking for work despite running and maintaining an LLC in the visual arts.  I know my future is in tech, regardless of wether I'm learning dilligently on my own, or speeding up that process by accepting a full time position.  In short, I'm flexible.  I'm considering offers, but I am not in any hurry to accept.

Please remember this portfolio is a work in progress.  My cohort ran from October of last year to this February, and during that time, responsibilities to my LLC were piling up.  Since graduating the program, I've accepted invitations to present in a group exhibit later this year, a solo show for 2022, and I've made my first international sale!

I'll be shifting my priorities back now towards programming and building up my portfolio and producing my first mobile application!  

In the mean time, I've shared below the git repository links to the two projects I produced during my time at Code Platoon, as well as the repo for my git hub pages, which currently has nothing more than my name and an interactive screen where you can play with shapes.
