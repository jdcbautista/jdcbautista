### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you're looking for more info on my Spotify or Truth of Dare projects, I have some video clips uploaded on my github portfolio: https://jdcbautista.github.io/ .  In the mean time, feel free to check out the repo for either project below.

May 19th, 2021:
My portfolio @ https://juliusbautista.com will be down for up to 72 hours while I switch hosting providers.  You can view my web portfolio @ "https://devfolio-75dda.web.app/" in the meantime.  Cheers!
