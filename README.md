### Sup ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julius and I'm passionate about storytelling, education and examining how our experiences impact our lives.

The story of my own journey as a programmer isn't typical, but who doesn't like to stray off the beaten path, at least once in a while?

The best is yet to come, and I'm working quietly and diligently towards that greater future.

Are you also passionate about inspiring others and changing the world?  Hit me up on LinkedIn.

In particular, I'm looking for help with:
- Social Media Management
- Marketing
- Branding
